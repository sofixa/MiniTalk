MiniTalk
=======

A simple client-server "chat" using UNIX signals

<b>How-to:</b> <br />
Compile the source(run make), then launch the server, copy the PID it will show, then launch the client with that same PID as an argument. Afterwards you can send messages from the client, and they will be received and shown by the server.

<b>Why:</b><br />
This project was realised as a Rush(a very limited time school assignment for 42, a French IT University) by amaurer and atodorov
